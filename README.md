# Linux-full-printer-support
This is the way of installing full Printer and Scanner support on Archlinux and Debian plus their derivatives.

Sometimes cups or gutenprint alone isn't enough to get your printer working. I had said problem with my BROTHER printer, both with the libre drivers and the propietary one from BROTHER themself.
After an amount of trying I got it to work. But I did not want my laptop to be limited to a small load of printers but be able to print in every household or workspace so I created these command lists for
Archlinux(pacman) and Debian(apt) to get as good as possible printing support.

Typing/Pasting in these commands should give you full printer and scanner support on Arch Linux and Debian. The same applies for their derivatives aslong as the
packages are available in their package manager
**NOTE: Ubuntu and Fedora will probably have all the packages installed**

This is without a guarantee, I created the lists for my Arch system and tried to adjust them to Debian as good as possible.

**NOTE: If you are using Devuan... or Artix... (non-systemd using distros) you will have to customize the commands to your need**
